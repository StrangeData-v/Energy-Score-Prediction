## INTRODUCTION:
The building and working of a consturcture based on usage of energy such as electirc power. So the point is that different types of building have different energy wasting or using level. This project were borned to solve this question. We got a dataset consisting __11746__ rows and __60__ features, which is the index discription of a building among kinds of dimensions, such as *Largest Property Use Type - Gross Floor Area*,*DOF Gross Floor Area* and so on.

## MODEL ALGRITHMS:
`SVM``LinearRegression``GradientBoosting``KNN``RandomForest`

## PROMOTE PARAMETERS:
`RandomizedSearchCV``GridSearchCV`

## EVALUEATE SCALER:
`MAE``PRECISION SCORE`

## RESULTS:
MAR = 9.3009
SCORE = 0.8605
